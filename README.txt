# gmancalculator
This is a calculator i made in python
To Run It Open Command Prompt (It Won't Work If Python Isn't Installed) If Python Is Installed It Works Anyways Goto Where The File Is Located If You Put The Python File On You're Desktop Then Type "cd desktop" without quotes in command prompt
After Going To Where It's Located Type "python gmancalculator.py" If It Somehow Doesn't Work Then Type "python3 gmancalculator.py" Both Might Work I Think Not Sure
And That's How To Run It In Command Prompt
